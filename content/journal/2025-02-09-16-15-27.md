description: "The Paradox of Control in Information Flow"
canonicalURL: ""
---

If the aim is true information flow, perhaps the most effective approach isn’t control, but the removal of barriers. Rules create friction, and in a complex network, friction slows dissemination. An open system, free of constraints, might organically lead to broader and more efficient sharing.

Maybe true knowledge expansion isn’t about enforcing reciprocity but trusting in the emergent behaviors of an unrestricted network.
