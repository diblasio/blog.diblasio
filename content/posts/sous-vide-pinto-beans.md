As a transplanted Texan native living in Netherlands, I've been missing good TexMex style pinto beans. Of course we can get them in a can, or pressure cook them, however, I wanted to try something new and decided to try to sous vide them. The folks at [Polyscience Culinary][polyscience-link] suggest a broad range for cooking legumes sous vide, and [Anova Culinary][anova-link] offers their take on no-soak beans. Striking a balance between these recommendations, I decided to take a middle path, opting for the traditional approach of soaking my beans overnight, which is thought to help with digestibility and even cooking. Then, I cooked them at a precise 87°C for 6 hours, aiming for that perfect creamy texture.

Here's how I prepared my sous vide pinto beans:

**Ingredients**
- 173 grams (1 cup) dried pinto beans, soaked overnight in water 
- 1/2 a medium red onion, cut in half
- 3 cloves of garlic, smashed and peeled
- 1 bay leaf (remember it next time!)

**Instructions**
1. Prepare a 1% saltwater solution for soaking the beans. To do this, dissolve 5 grams of salt in 495 grams of water.
2. Place the dried pinto beans in a small bowl and cover them with the saltwater solution. Cover and soak overnight.
3. After soaking the beans overnight, drain them but do not rinse. Prepare a fresh 1% saltwater solution using the same ratio (5 grams of salt in 495 grams of water) for cooking.
4. Preheat your sous vide machine to 87°C.
5. Place the beans, onion, garlic, and bay leaf in a large glass jar, sealing it tightly.
6. Submerge the jar in the water bath and let it cook for 6 hours.
7. Carefully remove the jar, open it, and serve the beans with your favorite TexMex accompaniments.

The beans appear tender and well-cooked, visible through the clear glass jar, which is sealed with a metal clamp-down lid. Bubbles cling to the sides of the jar, indicating the cooking process. The water bath container is placed on a kitchen countertop, with a white towel underneath it and kitchen tiles in the background." >}}

The pinto beans are plump and appear tender, nestled in a savory sauce. The enchilada is smothered in melted cheese and browned to perfection, and the rice is speckled with flecks of green herbs. The dish is served on a white plate set against a dark-toned background, creating an inviting contrast that emphasizes the vibrant colors of this TexMex meal." >}}

Overall I'd say they turned out great. Super creamy and worked perfectly with some home made salsa. Next time I'll try the 1% salt solution and try to remember the bay leaf.
