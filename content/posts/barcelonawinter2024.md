I had an incredible extended weekend in Barcelona, indulging in delicious foods, wandering the city, and capturing its beauty through my lens.

### Friday, February 2, 2024
Our journey began with an early flight from Schiphol, requiring a 5:30 AM departure from our home. Trading the 5°C rain in the Netherlands for Barcelona's sunny 20°C was a welcome change after enduring months of winter. Our first stop? Coffee. [Syra Coffee](http://www.syra.coffee) provided the perfect caffeine kick to start our adventure. With time to spare before our apartment check-in, we strolled to the vibrant market on La Rambla, where we were lucky enough to snag seats at [Bar Boqueria](https://barboqueria.com). The experience was nothing short of magical: leisurely service, fresh and flavorful seafood. I would definitely return if given the chance.

Dinner reservations at [Barbena](https://berbenabcn.com/en) capped off our day. Despite the chef's table's cozy ambiance, the service stood out as truly impeccable. Here's the scene outside the restaurant:

In the foreground, there are individuals engaged in a discussion, with one person holding what appears to be a cell phone. In the background, a group of people is seen near a metro entrance sign. The atmosphere suggests a casual gathering or meet-up, possibly during an event. There are several pedestrians on the street and cyclists passing by. A brightly lit building with a modern design can be observed on the right side of the image, contributing to the urban night setting." >}}

Despite a less-than-perfect bed, the promise of excellent coffee lured us out of our apartment. [Cafeteria Salvatge Coffee Gràcia](https://www.salvatgecoffee.com)’s pour-over, served uniquely in wine glasses, was a revelation, offering hints of jasmine. Breakfast followed at [Baluard Barceloneta](https://www.baluardbarceloneta.com), where the chocolate croissant was a flaky, buttery delight.

The day's warmth beckoned us to the beach, a perfect prelude to our lunch at Can Fisher. Selecting from the catch of the day, we indulged in a sumptuous paella and grilled fish.

The rice is speckled with saffron-infused grains and garnished with herbs, creating an appetizing centerpiece for the dining table in the background." >}}

Our afternoon was spent exploring the Gracia neighborhood, though our attempt to visit Park Guell was thwarted by capacity limits. Nevertheless, the area's charm was undeniable. Dinner at [La Graciosa](https://www.instagram.com/lagraciosabcn) was a bustling affair, enhanced by excellent food, wine, and service.

### Sunday, February 4, 2024
Unable to resist, we returned to [Cafeteria Salvatge Coffee Gràcia](https://www.salvatgecoffee.com) for another exceptional coffee experience. A serendipitous discovery, [Oz Bakery](https://ozbakerybcn.myshopify.com), offered the most photogenic and delicious croissants, which we couldn't help but devour on the spot.

Beyond gastronomy, we delved into local culture at the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, taking advantage of free entry on the first Sunday. During my visit to the [What is Humanity?](https://www.museunacional.cat/en/what-humanity) exhibition, I was immersed in a poignant reflection on the human condition through the art of the post-World War II and Spanish Civil War era. This exhibit, featuring around a hundred works from both renowned and lesser-known artists, delves into the depths of human despair, hope, and the complexities of our existence in the aftermath of profound turmoil. The artworks, bridging the gap between existential crises and a shared cultural spirit, echo the unsettling similarities between the past and our present-day conflicts. It's a stark reminder of humanity's unlearned lessons, as the same themes of war and destruction persist. The exhibition not only showcases the artists' attempts to grapple with their realities but also serves as a mirror to our own, questioning why humanity continues to walk a path fraught with conflict despite the clear messages from our past.

He is surrounded by abstract shapes and patterns that are predominantly red and yellow, with some blue accents. The overall mood of the piece conveys a sense of chaos and emotional turmoil." >}}

There's also a really nice view from the rooftop that shouldn't be missed.

We had a lunch reservation arranged at [Xemei](https://www.xemei.es), a Venetian restaurant. It's a first for me, but we all enjoyed every bite. Our agreed favorite was a simple dish with fresh peas, bottarga, and an egg yolk on top. You stir it together and enjoy.

From here it was time to pack and head back home Monday. Until next time.
